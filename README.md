# Day-Planner

## Description

This website is a simple calendar app that uses dynamically updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript powered by jQuery. Events can be placed in the planner by hour and saved with local storage. Moment.js is used to display the current date at the top of the page as well as keep the page's color-coordination updated by events in the past, present, and future.

## Usage

When the planner site is opened, the user can see the current date displayed at the top of the screen. Below, there are time blocks for each hour of the workday(9-5). If the hour is in the past, the block is displayed with a grey background. The present block is red, and all future blocks are color-coded red.

Clicking into the timeblocks allows the user to input their event which can then be saved by clicking the save button next to the block. The data entered is saved in the user's local storage which allows them to refresh the page and keep their events.
